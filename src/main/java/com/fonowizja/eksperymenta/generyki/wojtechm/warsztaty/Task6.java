        Consumer<Object> print = System.out::println;
        workWithSingers(singers, print); // Compile error! Uncomment to check it out!

        /*
            I know that Singer can be printed.
            You know that too.
            But the compiler does not.
            It expects Consumer of Singers, not a Consumer of Objects.
            What to do now? <T extends Singer>? Maybe <?>?.
            Damn it. It's not working! What to do, what to do...
            If we use 'extends', it's expecting a subclass of a Singer. But we don't need a subclass.
            We need a super class!


            For now, you were using 'extends' only - defining an "Upper Bound" of type parameter.
            Or in other words, You were defining the 'highest possible' class in inheritance/family tree

                Object
                   |
                Singer
                   |
              ElvisPresley

            But now we need something above Singer, not below. In order to define "Lower Bound"
            You must use 'super' keyword!
            Example:
            We have 'demo' method that accepts List<? super Integer>
            Let's break that down:
                List<?> - this will be a list of some type
                <? super Integer> - given type will be superclass of Integer
            As you can see below, 'demo' method accepts List<Integer>, List<Number> and List<Object>
            (Integer extends Number and Number extends Object)
         */

        List<Integer> integers = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5);
        demo(integers);

        List<Number> numbers = new ArrayList<>(integers);
        numbers.add(3.14);
        demo(numbers);

        List<Object> objects = new ArrayList<>(numbers);
        objects.add(new Object());
        demo(objects);


        // Once you analyze this example fix 'workWithSingers' method, so it accepts
        // both Consumer<Singer> and Consumer<Object>
    }

    private static void demo(List<? super Integer> list) {
        for (Object o : list) {
            System.out.print(o);
            System.out.print(", ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
