    /** SUMMARY:
     * Before you start reading, make sure you have finished first 7 steps listed above class declaration
     *
     * Now you should have 2 similar implementations. One that uses Generics, and one that does not.
     * If you couldn't implement first method in plain Java4 style (because of reasons i guess),
     * then feel free to copy-paste it from 'java4Code.txt' file available in resources folder.
     *
     * Quick info: I'll keep talking about lists only, but same rules apply to all collections in java.
     *
     * As you already know - before Java 1.5 (in which generics were introduced)
     * all lists were lists of objects.
     * There was no type check at compile time, so you could add anything to any list.
     * When retrieving data from list you had to use casts that might fail.
     *
     * Generics allow us to define type of elements stored in list. Information about type allows compiler
     * to do checks for us in compile, effectively reducing number of class cast exceptions.
     *
     * How it works?

    private static void howItWorks() {
        // <String> tells compiler that we want to store only Strings in given list
        List<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();

        // Having information about type, it checks variables that are being added to a list
        // and prevents adding anything of different type.
        strings.add("first");
//        strings.add(3); // Compiler error

        // Retrieving data before generics required manual casting
        // Now compiler knows type of variables in list, so it 'adds' casts in compile time
        // After all, cast still exists in bytecode, but it's not in source code
        // This makes code cleaner and easier to understand
        String first = strings.get(0);
